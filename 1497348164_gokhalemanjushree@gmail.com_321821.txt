A tale of guiding stars
--------------------

Two stars
----------

This story is about the kitten and two stars. You must be thinking what is the realtion between stars and a kitten. But there is some connection. Let me make you travel to the time when world was lit  by the giant starts and ruled by fire.  The time when our creation might wasn't the plan of universe. The time where knowledge took birth and started its journey to expand as much as possible.  And there were these two stars watching all this and growing with it. They were the kids of universe, having so many siblings.  Growing with so many similarities to compare and keeping their uniqueness to let their existence to be count for.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother universe was knowing their existence was not just to take birth and die. She had some great planes for them. Like every other child of her she nourished them to concur all the qualities she wanted them to have. Although they had all the charm to be king, they had all the power and glory to let others follow them. But they were chosen to be a guide and a mentor to those who need them the most. She gave them all the power they need to help others.  They were the protectors of those who believe in their dreams. they were the gods to those who can not survive on their own. They were chosen to be warriors who will travel till the end for the universe to take it to the right path. They took the oath, that they will be at her service the way she want them to be and they started their journey. It has been millions and billions of years now but still they were doing their work with all the devotion and love.&nbsp;One day they asked their mother, that for whom they were doing all that? Because they were not able to see to whom they were guiding. for whom they were there, and then mother universe reveled the new world to them. A small beautiful planet which was about to take birth. One of their sibling "The Sun" was about to be a parent. That moment was so hard and was so painful. A massive explosion happened, exhaling bright light where many small baby planets took birth. That pain was not explainable, because it took out Sun into so many small small pieces. But when all those children came into this world all that pain seemed to be small and less important. And whole universe was the witness to see that beautiful creation.  One of the planet was the best creation where a new universe new life was about to start, our planet "The Earth".&nbsp;Mother universe was preparing itself to welcome this new little creation of this little planet and every small life on it. And at the same time those two stars were observing and trying to understand that how they are supposed to help such small planet and all the small lives on it. How exactly their mother want them to guide those who are the most smaller things they had ever seen? They were quite but having so many questions to ask. Mother universe was knowing about all the questions her kids has. With a calm gesture she replied them to keep calm and wait for the right time when you will find out for whom you are serving. You will yourself find the answer to all questions. And it is not about doing big things my child,  it is about doing everything no matter small or unimportant for you,but it can be important for those who need it and that is the best quality of a leader. A true leader never choose to whom he will help, instead he help every thing that need him for that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;With all this message they started solving their questions thought observing us for millions of years. They  saw us taking our first step. Trying to survive and finding food. They saw every soul on our planet growing and evolving. They saw us inventing fire, understanding nature and the way of its behavior. They saw us learning farming, traveling over seas and naming those who created us. They saw us growing to such extend where we started floating around our neighbors, trying to understand and learn. And then they come to know that they are chosen for a rightful thing.&nbsp;

The cat
----------

It is the beginning of summer here in Kiana, The most tough days of winter are over. Kiana is a city in Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska. The name Kiana  can be translated in English as  “place where three rivers meet".  If you can survive here in winter then this place is no less than heaven for those who really love nature. The living started here many centuries ago. when people had main focus to find food and heat to keep there bodies alive. Our history says there were vikings who  pioneered their lives here. Now there are many indigenous groups who live here.  From centuries the living here is simple and slowly evolving. We need more time we can say to grow, because on every step we have to first fight with cold and then do things. So one can say when whole world was growing so fast we were still fighting for our basic need to survive.  There are many changes in our lives now but it is hard sometimes to get some basic things.&nbsp;Here from so many years people  do fishing and hunting for living. But now they had started farming and harvesting of berries. We always have to be prepared for winter. It becomes very  complicated to survive in minus temperature and to find some food to live. People can do at least some of the things that can help but for animals like us have to face so many difficulties. So this is the place where I live and one more thing i forgot to mention that I am a Cat and my name is Istas.I don't know where I was born but a merchant took me here when I was a small kitten. And one day he left me near the river and I don't know where he went after that.  Then onward life started with difficulties and fights. Fight for shelter, food, and dogs running after to kill. It took many days for me to learn living here. People here don't invest in animals or things which are not so useful. Because they have to always think of minimal resources to use for maximum time. And hence they never took me as a better companion than a dog. So I started living on street with some of them who were like me. eating from thrown stuff and spending more time to find out rightful place where I can get more heat. We all used to sit together more often and used to talk about the ancient stories. Many of old cats used to tell us the stories of two stars. I had seen those two stars many time during night.&nbsp;Here nights are so beautiful. At the same time so killing because temperature drops to more than freezing level. Watching sky during night is so beautiful. The waves of beautiful blue green and red color float through big long trees touching their sharp tops and wind giggling. Watching stars from those pretty colored waves is so amazing.  No doubt why Santa Claus Choose this beautiful place to live for lives. Our history has so many stories of these waves. They say whenever any soul departures from earth it has to travel to heaven through these waves. We can see them and talk with them if we believe in it. They also say that these two stars show the right path to follow to the heaven. Many sailors follow these stars to not to miss the right direction.  They call them "Guiding Stars". Some call them "Stars of Destiny". Some call them "Brothers", and some call them "Stars of  Hope". Every name has some story associated with it. I love every story related to them. They are the most precious stars to me. When I came here for the first time I was alone. But these two stars are the witness to all the bad and good times I had seen. They are ray of hope for me to live another tough day in winter. We all say and we believe that they keep us warm and our hearts full of hope always. They are watching us and taking good care of us.But now good days are going to come "Summer days". And I am so happy because I don't have to live alone now. I will have a beautiful baby soon. With whom this summer will become more interesting and happy. Here it is very hard for newly born to be alive in winter. They die within some days. But my baby will be able to live and will be able to grow strong. I wish and pray it get all the things to strengthen his body so that it can see more winters and summers coming.&nbsp;After struggling for long time finally I gave birth to a beautiful kitten, I named him "Etu". They say it means "The Sun". When I saw him for the first time trying to open his little eyes was the best moment of my life. I was feeling his first touch and his cute little voice. World felt so beautiful to me that day. But to take care of my baby was not an easy task. Even though I was familiar with this place. Keeping my snow ball safe from all the bad things was the most important thing to me. Some days passed on, he started walking and running after me. I started walking longer distance to get more food so that I can feed him. With every new day I started teaching him. Showing different places in my town where he can live. Teaching him to hunt. I started passing on all the knowledge I had about all the good and bad things. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Early days
----------

Wake up Etu, Wake up! open up your little eyes dear see how wonderful the sky is! Just like you my dove. It was a beautiful night with so many colors in the sky. With those colorful waves floating around dancing with the wind and creating a rhythm to make every living soul dance with it. Many stars shining in the dark blue sky. Blinking, like they all were giggling around. Cold but calm wind gave shivering feeling every time it touched. And a freshly fallen snow felt like you are seating on a white big cloud. Etu struggled a bit to get out of sleep, but what he saw after that made him cheer up and jump with joy. Wondering and trying to understand that beautiful picture. With his sweet little voice&nbsp;, he started asking questions to Istas. As she knew already, and was prepared to answer. She somehow stopped him from jumping around and grabbed him near her chest. She licked him for some time to warm him and then she started with a beautiful story which was her favorite too.Many years ago when our planet was born, many stars felt in love with it. They all saw the diversity it had. The beauty limits the words, combination of many colors. Made from fire, land, water and air. Different types of species living on it, and a power to take care of all of them. There were these two stars who unknowingly felt the same. The love for this little planet was like I love you, my baby. She continued with a kiss on Etu's forehead. They were brothers who loved one thing. Until the time they both were unknown from the feelings of other. One day Earth got injured with a strong hit by a giant Comet. It was so dangerous that many animals on the earth died in that accident. Earth was badly injured, they both saw the pain she was suffering from, and they tried so many things to take care of her. And suddenly they both found that they love the same thing. Now it was tough for both to accept it and to choose who will have her. They had a small fight. They went to their mother, asked her about why they are same and equal in everything, how they can judge who is best to for earth.Mother universe loved both of them equally so she was also confused to answer. She said better you ask Earth. Whom she love. The Star she will select should be the right Star to love her. Now both the stars came back to earth, but didn't have the courage to ask. Fearing what will be her answer. Then finally after taking so long they asked her, whom she loves? Earth was also confused to answer she said I had seen you from the time I came into existence. You are those two who had always have &nbsp;showed me the right path. All the knowledge I have it had come from you. So you both are equally important to me. And hence I cannot choose one from both of you. and I cannot lose you both.They both went sad, thinking how they both can live with her. Earth noticed that. Then she replied back gently. But I cannot live with any of you. As you can see there are many children's of mine living on me? They are so small and fragile that they will die if any of you live close to me. Your massive fire will kill them all. Then both the stars realized that they were chosen and born to take care of all of us living on Earth. They reminded of the oath they took. That day they decided, they will always take care of us, they won’t go far away. They will be always there whenever any soul on this planet need them. And every one of us will be able to see them every night. They will guide every soul; they will take care of us. They will love us like their children. It doesn't matter where you are Etu. Whenever you will be confused and don't have any answer to your questions. Whenever you lose hope and lost your way. Just believe in these two stars and follow them. You will find right path always dear. You will succeed. They will always guide you home.That night Etu actually saw those two guiding stars who were about to write his fate. Who were going to be so important for him to live life ahead and walk a path to his future?Life was going great, Etu was growing healthy and happy. Watching him play and learning new things always made Istas happy. They were a small happy family. She was a great mother and a great teacher. Every day she trained him somethings which was creating a strong and a good soul. The training include food search, tracking, finding new places, climbing walls and so many things. And every day they had endless of talk about the place they are living, their stories, the sky and everything Etu was able to see. But one-day things changed suddenly. It was a snow storm last for so many days. Many animals were suffering from cold and starvation. And many of them died. Istas was trying to save her child. She knew they won’t survive without food. And hence one night when Etu was sleeping she went outside in search of food. The snowfall was so heavy that nothing was visible and there was no way to go. But she tried, and then she vanished into it somewhere which was never going get her back home.Next day when Etu woke up, he searched for his mother. She was nowhere. He cried and cried for so long. Without his mother, the world was changed. It turned into a&nbsp;bad and dangerous place where he can see nothing good. There was fear and darkness in his heart. He was alone, weak, hungry, and helpless, with no clue what happened to his mother? Where is she? Is she is going to come home,ever? He tried to search her outside, but the storm was so dangerous that he was not able to walk into it. He came back. The weakness and sadness made him fall asleep again. That night the storm slowed down somehow.Next day it was over. There was a big bright sky and everything was looking normal, but Etu was struggling to find out his mother. He tried to search her at every place he knew. The places were Istas used to take him. He was searching her presence in everything he can see. He was missing her badly. The memories he had about her were flowing through his mind like a strong wind, her voice the things she used to say he was hearing it again, but this time he wanted them again and again. He wanted that only thing. He was trying to convince himself that she is going to come by the end of the day.Some days passed on like this. He was doing things on his own. He was walking alone, searching alone for food and shelter. But in every moment Istas presence was there. Her memories were enlightening his path. Etu came to know the price of whatever she taught him. One night he was walking back to home, he started crying and calling for Istas. The tears and the shaking voice were telling his urge to see her again, and how badly he needed her. He craved for her so long, looking up into the sky he tried to ask every god his mother told him about. Why god was so cruel and tough that he took the only thing he had. There he saw those two stars, and he got stuck for some time. he watched them quietly thinking they are the guiding stars, mother told me they will always look after me then why they didn't helped mother to get back home. Where is she? Aren’t they guiding her home? Then he realized his mother’s saying, to follow them when you lose your path and don't know what to do. Etu didn't believe in those stars but he had faith in Istas and her sayings. That day he decided to follow them and find her, "If she believed in them for her whole life then they have to guide me to her.”&nbsp;&nbsp;
